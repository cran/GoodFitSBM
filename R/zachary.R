#' Zachary Karate Club Data
#'
#' Zacharyâ€™s Karate club data is a classic, well-studied social network of friendships between 34 members of a Karate club at a US university, collected by Wayne Zachary in 1977. Each node represents a member of the club, and each edge represents a tie between two members of the club. The network is undirected. An often discussed problem using this dataset is to find the two groups of people into which the karate club split after an argument between two teachers. Refer to the example in README.
